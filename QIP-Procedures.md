The following proposal intends to implement a new standard for the creation, review, and submission of proposals to QiDao’s governing DAO.

If implemented, all DAO votes will have to follow the following procedures. Community discussions will still take place on QiDao’s Discord.

### What is a QIP?

QIP stands for QiDao Improvement Proposal, which has been in use at QiDao for several years. The purpose of these proposals is to ensure changes to QiDao are transparent and well governed. A QIP is a document providing information to the QiDao community about a proposed change to the system. The author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

### QIP Process

Parties involved in the process are the author, the editors, QiDao Core Contributors, the QiDao community.

Important notice for authors: before beginning this process, please make sure to vet your idea with the QiDao community. Ask the QiDao community first if an idea is original to avoid wasting time on something that will be rejected based on prior research. It also helps to make sure the idea is applicable to the entire community and not just the author. The appropriate public forum to gauge interest around your QIP is the QiDao Discord.

Each status change is requested by the author and reviewed by the editors. Use a pull request to update the status. The editors will process these requests as per the conditions below.

1. Draft - The initial state of a new QIP before it has been assessed
2. Review Pending - a QIP that is being assessed for feasibility with an assigned Core Contributor
3. Vote Pending - a QIP that is awaiting a vote.
4. Approved - a QIP that has successfully reached sufficient support from the DAO via voting
5. Rejected - a QIP that has failed to reach sufficient support from the DAO via voting
6. Implemented - a QIP that has been released to mainnet

New proposals must follow the template here.

Quorum standard for all future votes will be a simple majority of participating votes.

### Auxiliary Files

Proposals may include auxiliary files such as diagrams. Such files must be named QIP-XXXX-Y.ext, where “XXXX” is the proposal number, “Y” is a serial number (starting at 1), and “ext” is replaced by the actual file extension (e.g. “png”).

### Editors

The current editors will be

* https://github.com/publu
* https://github.com/benjamin891

### Editor Responsibilities

For each new proposal that comes in, an editor does the following:

* Read the proposal to check if it is ready: sound and complete. The ideas must make technical sense, even if they don't seem likely to get to final status.
* The title should accurately describe the content.
* Check the proposal for language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.), markup (Github-style Markdown), code style
* If the proposal isn't ready, the editor will send it back to the author for revision, with specific instructions.

Once the proposal is ready for the repository, the editor will:

1. Assign proposal number
2. Merge the corresponding pull request
3. Send a message back to the author with the next step

The editors don't pass judgment on proposals. They merely fulfill administrative & editorial duties.
