### **Summary**

This QIP seeks community approval to establish a Beta Vault Testing Framework for testing new features and vaults. The initial beta-mode deployment will allocate a maximum of 100,000 MAI debt ceiling for vaults. This framework enables live testing and measured scaling of new collateral types prior to full launch.

---

### **Motivation**

New collateral types are essential to the continued growth and evolution of QiDao. However, launching untested assets carries inherent risks. The Beta Vault testing framework allows QiDao to validate performance under real-world conditions while keeping exposure capped.

This proposal sets a formal process for launching Beta Vaults and approves the first instance with a 100,000 MAI debt ceiling to allow for user testing, finalization, and operational readiness.

---

### **Pre-Approved Vault Parameters**

Initial parameters for vaults under this framework are standardized for Beta-mode deployments, starting with veAERO:

* Interest Rate: 0%  
* Minimum Collateral-to-Debt Ratio: 250%  
* Minimum Debt per Vault: 10 MAI  
* Maximum Borrowable Debt per Vault: 500,000 MAI

**Beta Scaling Strategy**  
In order to scale up to the approved 100K MAI debt ceiling, new Beta Vaults will initially start with 10,000 MAI available for testing. Once that limit is reached, this beta debt ceiling can be increased which will be handled by the QiDao multisigs up to 100K MAI with no further governance action required.

---

### **Risk Management**

* Controlled Exposure: A high collateralization ratio and phased ceiling limits risk for beta vaults.  
* QiDao Guardians Oversight: Scaling is managed by QiDao Guardians to ensure on-chain performance meets expectations.  
* Final vault parameters, oracle source and risk grading can be modified via additional proposals before Beta Vault graduation and Full Onboarding.

---

### **Next steps**

This Beta QIP vote enables QiDao to establish a structured framework for Beta testing new collateral types with tight risk controls and clear community involvement. Users who opt-in to participate in Beta Vaults can test alpha features before anyone else, give feedback and contribute to build a better QiDao. Full Onboarding, if conditions for graduation are met, will be executed via later proposals.

### **Quorum Standards**

The option with the most votes will be adopted.

### **Voting Options**

* Yes: Approve the Beta Vault framework.  
* No: Do not approve the Beta Vault framework at this time.  
* Needs more discussion: Supportive of the direction, but revisions are needed.  
* Abstain
