**QIP Proposal: Enabling Voting Rights for beQI Holders on QiDao**

---

### Summary

This QIP proposes to extend voting rights on QiDao proposals (QIPs) to holders of beQI tokens, recognizing their stake in the ecosystem and aligning their rights with those of aveQi holders, who already possess voting capabilities. This proposal seeks to ensure that all stakeholders, particularly beQI holders, have a say in the governance and future direction of the QiDao ecosystem.

### Abstract

The essence of this proposal is to grant voting rights to holders of beQI tokens, enabling them to participate in QiDao governance decisions on snapshot.org. Currently, aveQi holders (the aave version of Qi tokens) enjoy voting rights, which allows them to contribute to the decision-making process of the QiDao ecosystem. This proposal aims to extend the same rights to beQI holders, specifically focusing on unstaked beQI tokens, to ensure equitable participation across all token holders. Furthermore, this QIP calls for Beefy to actively communicate these voting rights to beQI holders, ensuring awareness and participation.

### Motivation

The rationale behind this proposal is twofold:
1. **Inclusivity in Governance**: beQI holders represent a significant portion of the QiDao community and should have a voice in governance decisions that shape the ecosystem. Extending voting rights to beQI holders ensures a more democratic and inclusive governance model.
2. **Precedent Set by aveQi Holders**: Given that aveQi holders already possess voting rights, it is both fair and logical to provide the same privileges to beQI holders, fostering a sense of equality and unity within the community.

### Specification

#### Rationale

Granting voting rights to beQI holders recognizes their investment and interest in the QiDao ecosystem. This move not only enhances governance participation but also strengthens the community's collective decision-making. The specification for voting weight will mirror that of aveQi, ensuring consistency and fairness in the governance process.

#### Technical Specification

- **Voting Mechanism Integration**: Integrate beQI tokens into the existing governance voting mechanism on snapshot.org, allowing beQI holders to vote on QIPs.
- **Voting Rights Communication**: Collaborate with Beefy to inform beQI holders of their newly granted voting rights, focusing on those holding unstaked beQI tokens.
- **Voting Weight**: The voting weight for beQI holders will be aligned with the current structure in place for aveQi holders, ensuring a balanced and equitable governance process.

### Implementation

- **Development**: Technical development to support beQI voting on snapshot.org, including any necessary smart contract adjustments or integrations.
- **Communication Strategy**: A detailed plan for Beefy and QiDao to jointly announce and explain the voting rights to beQI holders, ensuring clarity on the distinction between staked and unstaked tokens.
- **Timeline**: A proposed timeline for the rollout of voting rights, including development, testing, and communication phases.

By granting voting rights to beQI holders, QiDao moves towards a more inclusive and equitable governance model, recognizing the value and voice of every member of its community. This proposal reflects our commitment to democratic participation and the collective shaping of the QiDao ecosystem's future.
