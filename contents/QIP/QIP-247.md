title: Approve TetuQi Migration Terms
network: Polygon
status: Draft

### Summary

This proposal is for the Qi Dao community to decide how to compensate wallets with small balances of TetuQi in order for the Tetu team to continue to migrate these locked TetuQi funds to Ethereum.

The community would decide between a few options:
1. Distribute aveQI to wallets holding at least 500 tetuQI according to Tetu's snapshot linked below.
2. Distribute aveQI to wallets holding at least 500 tetuQI according to Tetu's snapshot, while offering compensation to dust wallets with less than 500 tetuQi.
3. Further discussion needed.

On Approval, our choice of action on these small balance TetuQi wallets would be passed to the Tetu team who would be able to start a migration of the other TetuQi funds on to the Ethereum network.

### Motivation

There are 302 wallets with Qi Tokens locked in the pegged TetuQi token on the Tetu platform on the Polygon network. Our Qi governance token has now migrated to Ethereum, but that has left these locked up TetuQi stuck on Polygon. Tetu would be willing to migrate tokens to Ethereum, but they are concerned about the number of wallets that hold very low $USD balances of TetuQi and want the Qi Dao community to agree what action to take for those small balance wallets before moving forward with a migration.

For multiple years, owners of Qi tokens were able to lock their tokens in the Tetu platform on the Polygon network to mint TetuQi tokens. There have been talks for over 9 months now with the Tetu team and within the Dao about migrating these locked up TetuQi tokens to Ethereum. The Tetu team has agreed to migrate tokens, but those talks have stalled between our two groups for months now. It is time for the QiDao governance members to decide what to do on this matter.
This would be similar to tokens being migrated by Beefy.Fi onto Ethereum.

### Specification

Between Tetu and Qi Dao teams, it has been placed onto our Dao to propose and agree as to what happens to small balances of TetuQi holders. It is not economical to pay gas fees to transfer these small balances, ~260 wallets of which are <10 $USDC value currently.

### Rationale

There are 302 holders of TetuQi according to PolygonScan, only 40 of these have more than 500 TetuQi / Qi in value going off a previously compiled list of TetuQi holders assembled 4+ months ago: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_irOFhIo7ykDNk0wQFHbmD5_D1bNI0lr9dxCD8kYg2Y/edit?gid=0#gid=0

Option 1: Approve Tetu to migrate wallets with balances over 500 tetuQI to a new product on Ethereum, approving treating balances of less than 500 tetuQI as dust.

Option 2: Approve Tetu to migrate wallets with balances over 500 tetuQI to a new product on Ethereum, offering wallets of values less than 500 tetuQI USDC or similar in compensation from QiDao funds at a later date. 

Option 3: Further discussion in the Qip Discussion Discord

It is not economical to migrate these small balances to Ethereum as it would cost the platforms much more in gas fees than the balances would be worth at least in the near/mid future. However option 2 leaves open the ability to financially compensate any TetuQI users, who have not yet given any input in the QIP discord, for dusting their small balances.


### Technical Specification

The resolution would be a confirmed decision by the DAO which would be taken by the development team or community to the Tetu team and they could migrate these tokens to an Ethereum product.
