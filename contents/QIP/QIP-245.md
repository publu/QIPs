### Summary
Coinbase Wrapped Bitcoin (cbBTC) is a tokenized Bitcoin product issued by Coinbase, fully backed 1:1 by Bitcoin in Coinbase custody. It allows Bitcoin to be utilized within Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems. Adding cbBTC as collateral for MAI will enable Bitcoin holders to access liquidity while increasing QiDao’s Total Value Locked (TVL) and utility of MAI within the Base ecosystem.
cbBTC has a Total Value Locked (TVL) of over $1.5 billion and strong on-chain liquidity across major decentralized exchanges, making it a suitable collateral asset.

Increased TVL and revenue: Onboarding cbBTC enables Bitcoin holders to access liquidity within the Base ecosystem, expanding MAI’s user base, increasing TVL, and generating more revenue for QiDao.

Risk Mitigation: cbBTC offers a simple and secure way to diversify and incorporate fully backed Bitcoin exposure.
Enhanced User Experience: Bitcoin holders can seamlessly use cbBTC to borrow MAI, providing a highly efficient way to utilize their Bitcoin holdings within the DeFi space.
