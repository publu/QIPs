title: Temp Check - Deploying on Mode
network: Mode
status: Draft

### Summary

This proposal serves to check the community's sentiment towards deploying on Mode. A future QIP will need to be passed to approve any new integrations.

### Abstract

If this proposal is approved, DAO contributors will work with the Mode team to architect a Mode-specific deployment that suits the needs of Mode users. Any new integrations will need to be approved by DAO governance in order to be supported by QiDao.

### Motivation

Mode is an L2 built on top of the OP stack. It has already integrated with the main DEX in the OP ecosytem, Velodrome. While the VELO gauge has not yet been connected to the Mode deployment, MODE rewards are currently supplementing incentivization. Having this integration points to Mode's connectivity with other OP chains and creates a fertile ground from which to establish a CDP stablecoin.

Mode is currently running a TVL-based points campaign, where users are incentivized in Mode points for providing TVL to native protocols. Having a long safety track record, QiDao can stand out in Mode as the most viable option for users to farm these points.

There is no native stablecoin on Mode. This presents an important opportunity for QiDao to grow in an environment with no alternative competitors.

### Specification

### Rationale

A temp check is being requested to first assess if the community is willing to deploy on Mode. This will serve as a threshold to ensure that team hours are spent wisely in discussing deals with new chains.

### Technical Specification

No technical implementation is needed at this stage.

### Configurable Values

N/A
